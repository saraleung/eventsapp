## Goal

The goal of the take home assignment is to evaluate basic understanding of:

- database
- backend technology
- frontend technology
- source control

## Description

- Database: create the following tables
  - Performer table with a name column
  - Event table that has a name column, datetime column
  - Relationship: an event has many performers
  - For example, the test data:
    - Event name: `Blue Jays vs Chicago Cubs`
    - Performers:
        - `Blue Jays`
        - `Chicago Cubs`

- Website:
  - Using a technology of your choice
  - Build a website to display existing events with their associated performers
  - You will prepopuate the database in advance with the above test data
  - A single web page to view an event and its associating performers. A simple table listing the event and performers is sufficient.
  - Write unit tests for any controller or model code

- SCM:
  - Clone or fork this repo to github or bitbucket

- Hosting (optional):
  - Use heroku to deploy your webapp on heroku.com. You can create a free heroku account to host sites there.
